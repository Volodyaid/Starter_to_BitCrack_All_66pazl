# Starter_to_BitCrack_All_66pazl
With these scripts, you can run the bitcrack program in all sections of the 66 puzzle with a sequential transition from one section to another and so on in a circle. Inside the scripts, depending on the capacity of your farm, you can change the length of the traversed section.
if you can find the private key from the address 66 of the puzzle with my help, please thank me by transferring to the BTC wallet bc1qhzzx0mx0fk3a076eq2ngk2txe2xna55938z52v
